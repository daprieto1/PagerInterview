# Pager backend code test

Welcome to the backend team code test!

This test consists of a small REST API that we have already started for you.

We have already setup 1 endpoint and its corresponding unit tests.

The unit tests also include (although commented out) other unit tests for 2 more endpoints that you need to implement with the help of one of our engineers.

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to assess your knowledge of our stack and how you work with frameworks or tools you are not familiar with: how you search the web for documentation, how you learn and test a new framework, etc.

## Setup

This project needs Node (version >= 12) and Docker or Mongo installed on your machine.

- Download this project to your computer
- run `npm i`
- run `docker-compose up -d` (if you skip the `-d`, this command will run in
    foreground) There's no need to run this command if you already have mongo running in `localhost:27017`
- run `npm test`
- Follow your interviewer instructions on what unit tests you should uncomment and start coding

Thanks and happy coding!

## FAQ

- **How much time do I have?**
-  *You have 60 minutes. There's no rush though, we don't set strict rules around what should be completed by this time because that changes between each candidate and their expertise in our stack*

- **Can I search Google if I don't know/remember how to implement something?**
-  *Yes, of course. We do it all the time.*
